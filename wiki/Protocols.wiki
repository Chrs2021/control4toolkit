= Introduction =

To this page I will try to add everything I understand how works in the control4 communication protocols. If you have something to contribute with, don't hesitate to drop me a line or two by mail or something :)

= c4soap =

== GetVersionInfo ==
When the director have found a device to connect to, it uses the xml-rpc-soap'ish interface "c4soap".

*All commands are ended with one \x00 character.*

The first thing the client says when it connects are 
{{{
<c4soap name="GetVersionInfo" async="False" />
}}}

Director will then respond to the GetVersionInfo command with something like
{{{
<c4soap name="GetVersionInfo" result="1">
  <versions>
    <version name="Director" version="1.3.2.318" buildtype="" builddate="Nov 13 2007" buildtime="17:45:35"/>
    <version name="MediaManager" version="1.3.2.318" buildtype="" builddate="Nov 13 2007" buildtime="17:58:55"/>
  </versions>
</c4soap>
}}}

Okay. Next step, pretty important

== EnableEvents ==

In the connection period, the composer also send this to the director
{{{
<c4soap name="EnableEvents" async="True">
  <param name="enable" type="bool">1</param>
</c4soap>
}}}
Which enables events to the composer, so, when stuff happens on the director, it will inform composer. Well, you get it. Events are events. And they are here enabled.



== GetItems ==
This will dump everything on the entire director. Pretty neat to get an overview :)
{{{
<c4soap name="GetItems" async="False">
  <param name="filter" type="number">0</param>
</c4soap>
}}}

== GetBindingsByDevice ==

== GetMediaByDevice ==
Returns what media you have. You can ask for playlists etc. Later.

== GetNetworkBindings ==
This is very neat! You'll get information about all your dimmers etc, what MAC addresses, types etc they are, and what internal deviceid they are.

== GetPhysicalDevices ==
Extensive information of the one above. More devices etc. You'll pretty much get everything from above here as well i think.
